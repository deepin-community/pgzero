pgzero (1.2.post4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial upload to Debian (previous versions were in raspberry pi
    foundation repository) (Closes: 892386)
  * Set myself as maintainer.
  * Merge upstream Master, turn upstream commit after latest release into
    quilt patch ( debian/patches/add-repl-to-roadmap.patch )
  * Strip out a number of examples/images/sounds etc due to unclear licensing
    (see debian/copyright for details), this does not cause any regressions for
    users as those files are not yet included in any binary packages.
  * Remove debian/patches/setup-readme.patch, merged upstream.
  * Cleanup egg info in clean target.
  * Remove outdated X-Python3-Version.
