+REPL
+----
+
+Python's REPL is a valuable feature that makes the language much more
+accessible to beginners.
+
+Python programs that present a user interface, however, rarely provide a REPL,
+because the main thread is used to run the event loop for the user interface.
+
+However, Javascript in a web browser demonstrates how this can work. You have
+access to an interactive REPL that allows investigating program state *while
+you interact with the interface*. This is very useful for debugging, and would
+be a powerful addition to Pygame Zero.
